# 🍲 Food Bridge – Food Waste Management System with Analytics Dashboard

**Food Bridge** is a full-stack web application designed to reduce food waste by connecting **surplus food vendors** with **NGOs in need of food resources**.

The platform provides a **data-driven ecosystem** where restaurants, event organizers, and vendors can quickly list surplus food while NGOs can search and request available donations in real time.

Unlike traditional donation platforms, Food Bridge integrates an **analytics-powered admin dashboard** to monitor platform activity, donation impact, and community engagement.
